# Project Title

Welcome to my educational and interactive space-themed game! This is Joaco's game, named after my son, Joaquin. Currently, he is 3 years old and I am teaching him how to read. He was my inspiration for building this game as he is deeply fascinated with space and anything related to it. I wanted to take advantage of this interest and use it to teach him how to spell. 

## Usage

In this cosmic adventure, your mission is to accurately recognize the images of various planets and then type the corresponding letters on the keyboard displayed to spell out their names. Get it right and you'll add more fuel to the rocket for the ride home! If you happen to find yourself lost in the vastness of space, don't worry! The game will gently nudge you towards the correct letter with a pulsating hint. If you're struggling to recognize a planet based on appearance alone, feel free to use the speech assistance button located on the far right for some a quick reminder. Embark on this interstellar journey to identify all 8 planets in our solar system, and once you've achieved this celestial feat, witness the thrilling spectacle of a rocket blasting off into the cosmos, signifying your victorious completion of the game.

This game is best when played in fullscreen mode.
